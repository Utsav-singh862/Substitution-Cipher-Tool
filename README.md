# Substitution-Cipher-Tool

This Python project implements a substitution cipher tool for encrypting and decrypting messages. Users can create custom cipher keys, encrypt messages using these keys, and save encrypted messages for later decryption. The program supports managing multiple keys, including listing, loading, generating, and deleting them. It also provides an interactive menu to make encryption and decryption simple, even for non-technical users.

Key Features:

-Custom Key Generation: Create a unique shuffled key for message encryption.

-Message Encryption: Encrypt any text message using a chosen key.

-Message Decryption: Decrypt messages with the corresponding key.

-File Management: Save encrypted messages to files and load them later.

-Key Management: List available keys, load existing keys, or delete unused keys.

-Interactive CLI: Easy-to-use menu interface for encryption, decryption, and key management.

Use Case:
This project is suitable for learning about basic cryptography, substitution ciphers, and file handling in Python. It is educational and can also be used for simple secure message storage.
